## Installation

    library(devtools)
    install_github("ClemensKohl/APL")

### Install pytorch with reticulate

    library(reticulate)
    install_miniconda() 
    conda_install(envname = "r-reticulate", packages = "numpy")
    conda_install(envname = "r-reticulate", packages = "pytorch")

### Manually install pytorch with conda

Download the appropriate Miniconda installer for your system from [the conda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). 
Follow the installation instructions on their website and make sure the R package reticulate is also installed before proceeding.
Once installed, list all available conda environments via <br>
`conda info --envs` <br>
One of the environments should have `r-reticulate` in its name. Depending on where
you installed it and your system, the exact path might be different.
Activate the environment and install pytorch into it.

    conda activate ~/.local/share/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate # change path accordingly.
    conda install numpy
    conda install pytorch
