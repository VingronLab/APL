## Input data: 39 rows x 20 columns

## Analysess:

#1. 39 genes and 19 dimensions
#2. 39 genes and 4 dimensions
#3. 20 genes and 4 dimensions

# Sample IDs which I used to compute the AP:
6, 7, 8, 10, 12 (counting of samples starts from 1)

# Output:

- "AP.jpg" - Association Plot
- "2D.jpg" - 2D correspondence analysis
- "AP_coordinates_genes.txt" - coordinates of genes in the AP - the order of genes is changed, see: genes_order.txt
- "AP_coordinates_samples.txt" - coordinates of samples in the AP
- "genes_order.txt" - the order of genes in AP_coodinates_genes.txt file
- "gene_ranking.txt" - gene ranking according to the AP and Salpha scores (calculated based on 10 permutations) #There are also gene coordinates from AP, so probably this will be the best file to use for you
