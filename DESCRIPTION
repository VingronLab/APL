Description: APL is a package developed for computation of Association Plots
  (AP), a method for visualization and analysis of single cell transcriptomics 
  data. The main focus of APL is the identification of genes characteristic for
  individual clusters of cells from input data. The package performs 
  correspondence analysis (CA) and allows to identify cluster-specific
  genes using Association Plots. Additionally, APL computes the 
  cluster-specificity scores for all genes which allows to rank the genes by 
  their specificity for a selected cell cluster of interest.
